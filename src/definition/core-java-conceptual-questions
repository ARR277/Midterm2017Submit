Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?

    1. The Runtime Interpreter:
        It is the core runtime module for the Java system. It provides the support to run Java executable programs in compiled,
        bytecode format.

    2. The Compiler(javac):
        It is essential to Java Life Cycle. javac compile Java source code files into executable Java bytecode classes.
        The javac takes source code files that have the extension ".java" and generates executable class files with the ".class"
        extension.

    3. The Applet Viewer:
        A tool that serves as a minimal test bed for final release Java applets as to run and debug programs without a web browser.

    4. The Debugger(jdb):
         A simple command-line debugger for Java classes. It is a demonstration of the Java Platform Debugger Architecture that
         provides inspection and debugging of a local or remote Java Virtual Machine.

    5. The Class File Disassembler(javap):
        It is the command to disassembles a class file. Its output depends on the options used. If no options are used, javap
        prints out the public fields and methods of the classes passed to it. javap prints its output to stdout.

    6. The Header and Stub File Generator(javah):
        Generates C header and source files that are needed to implement native methods. javah are used by C programs to reference
        an object's instance variables from native source code. The .h file contains a struct definition whose layout parallels
        the layout of the corresponding class.

    7. The Documentation Generator(javadoc):
        a documentation tool which defines a standard format for such comments, and which can generate HTML files to view the
        documentation from a web browser.

    8. Applet Demos:
        An applet is a program written in the Java programming language that can be included in an HTML page, much in the same way
        an image is included in a page.

    9. API Source Code:
        A set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. And specifies how software components should
        interact. Especially APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.

What is IDE?

    IDE, Java Integrated Development Environment, is a software application which enables users to more easily write and debug Java
    programs. It normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?

    NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ Idea, BlueJ, Android Studio, DrJava, Enide Studio 2014, jEdit, jGRASP, JSource, JDeveloper

Explain the entire java life cycle.

    First, when creating your own program, your source code will be compiled by the Java Compiler, javac, with the extension ".java"
    e.g. "file.java".
    Next, javac will convert it to bytecode format with the extension ".class" e.g. "file.class".
    Lastly, it is loaded to JVM, Java Virtual Machine, by the JVM class loader. JVM will convert the bytecode format to binary machine
    language which will be read by the computer operating system.

what is class?

    It is a blueprint that describe both its attributes and behaviors.

What is object?

    It is an instance of a class with the class' attributes and behavior.

What is the entry point of an application?

    It is where the control is transferred from the operating system to a computer program, at which place the processor enters a
    program or a code fragment and execution begins.

Why main is static?

    Main must be static for the JVM to call on main as main is the starting program.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?

    Interface can support multiple inheritance and consist only incomplete members. Unlike Interface, Abstract class can have
    data members, constructor(s), either can be static, can access modifiers for sub, functions and properties, and consist of
    both complete and incomplete members.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?

    Interface:      No. Interface is completely abstract but it can be implemented by a sub-class.

    Abstract Class: Yes.

what is Access Specifier?

    To access the classes, methods, and fields that are being regulated by access modifiers.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.

    OOP, Object-Oriented Program, is a programming language model that are organized around objects rather than "actions" and
    data rather than logic. In particular manner, a logical procedure that takes input data, processes it, and produces output data.
    -Abstraction:
        A process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user.
        In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it.
    -Encapsulation:
        A mechanism of wrapping the variables and code acting on the methods together as a single unit.
        The variables from a class, say class Apple, is hidden from other classes and can only access within class Apple. However,
        the variable can be accessed only through the methods of class Apple. This is known as data hiding.
    -Inheritance:
        A class where it can acquire methods and fields from another class in a hierarchical order.
        A class is a sub-class, or child class, if the class inherits properties from another class.
        A class is a super-class, or parent class, if the class inherits properties to the sub-class.
    -Polymorphism:
        The ability of an object to take on many forms.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.

    API, Application Programming Interface, is a collection of pre-written packages, classes, and interfaces with their respective
    methods, fields and constructors.
        -BufferedReader     -Character          -Exception(s)       -File
        -FileReader         -HashMap            -HashTable          -Integer
        -List               -ArrayList          -LinkedList         -Math
        -PrintStream        -Random             -Scanner            -Stack
        -Queue              -String             -Deque              -Collection
        -Iterator           -Vector             -

Does java support multiple inheritance?

    No.

What is method overloading and when it happens?

    It is multiple methods with the same name but with different set of parameters. It happens at compile time.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.

    An Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event that cause the normal flow of the program to disrupted and abnormally terminates
    the program/Application .
    It can be caused by either the user's error, the programmer's error, or the physical resources that have failed in some manner.
    It can be handled by five keywords: try, catch, throw, throws, and finally.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?

    It is a keyword in which it is used for mainly memory management and belongs to the class than instance of the class.
    Variables:
        -To refer the common property of all objects.
        -Gets memory only once in class area at the time of class loading.
    Methods:
        -It can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
        -It can access static data member and can change the value of it.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?

    It is a keyword in which it is used to restrict the user.
    Variables:
        -The value of the variable remains fixed and cannot be changed.
    Methods:
        -The method cannot be override.

What is final, finally and finalize?

    -Final is a keyword. It is used to apply restrictions on class, method, and variable.
        For class, it cannot inherited to class; for method, it cannot be override; and for variable, it cannot change the value
        once the value is initialized by the programmer.
    -Finally is a block. It is used to place important code to be executed whether the exception is handled or not.
    -Finalize is a method. It is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.

What is a constructor ?

    It is a block of code much similar to a method that doesn't have a return type and is/are not considered members of a class.
    The constructor must have the same name as the name of the class and is called automatically when an object is instantiated.

What is "this" keyword in java ?

    It is a keyword that is reference to the current object whose method or constructor is being invoked. It is used to refer any
    member of the current object from within an instance method(s) or constructor(s).

What is "super" keyword in java?

    It is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object. When the child class is instantiated, an
    instance of the parent class is created implicitly which is referred by super reference variable.

What is JVM stand for ?

    Java Virtual Machine

What version of java are you using?

    jdk1.8.0_141

What is JAR stand for ?

    Java Archive

What is compile time and run time?

    Compile Time:
        The time for the source code to compile into machine code in order to become and executable program.
    Runtime:
        The time for the program/application already compiled running.

What is heap?

    -The runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.
    -Created on virtual machine start-up.
    -Its' storage for objects is reclaimed by an automatic storage management system, a garbage collector; objects are never
      explicitly de-allocated.

How java manage it's memory?

    The java objects reside in an area called the heap.
    The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs. When the heap
    becomes full, garbage is collected. During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making
    space for new objects.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?

    String:
        -It is an immutable object;
    StringBuffer/StringBuilder:
        -It is an mutable object;
        StringBuffer:
            -It is synchronized.
        StringBuilder:
            -It is not synchronized.

What is Singleton class?

    The use of Singleton class is to keep only one instance of a class at any time and its purpose to control object creation
    by keeping private constructor.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?

    Serialization:
         A process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent
         through streams.
    Deserialization:
        It is the reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?

    Integer

Why is String Immutable in Java?

     Because Java uses the concept of string literally. For example, if there were 5 reference variables all refers to one String
     object and if one reference variable changes the value of the object, then it will be affected to all the reference variables.

What is constructor chaining in Java?

    It is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor. It is either calling another constructor using the keyword
    "this()" with the specific number of parameter in the same class; or using the keyword "super()" from another class, known as parent
    class when one class extends another class.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?

    Parallel Garbage Collector uses multiple thread for garbage collection operation than Serial Garbage Collector.

What is JIT stands for?

    JIT, Just In Time.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?

    Heap in Java generally located at bottom of address space and move upwards. Whenever create an object using new operator or by any
    another means the object is allocated memory from Heap. And when object dies or garbage collected, memory goes back to Heap space
    in Java. And JVM provides the mechanism of Garbage collection to reclaim heap space from objects which are eligible for Garbage
    collection.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?

    In Java, Yes. The programmer does not need to care for all those objects which are no longer in use as Garbage collector destroys
    them.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?

    Stack memory is used to store local variables and function call as Heap memory is used to store objects in Java.
    In the computer's RAM, Stack is used for static memory allocation and Heap is used for dynamic memory allocation.
